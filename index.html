            herself stuck in a long-term, one-sided relationship with her
            indifferent boyfriend, Minu Kang. Despite her feelings for him,
            Su-ae struggles with self-doubt, wishing she could emulate her
            confident stepsister, Ra-im Yun. Her life takes an unexpected turn
            when she discovers Jellypop, a sentient flip phone, which provides
            guidance on her complicated love life. As Su-ae's relationship with

            However, as they spend more time together, Eunhyeok begins to
            appreciate Su-ae's sincerity and genuine nature. His feelings for
            her deepen, and he eventually confesses his love, though Su-ae
